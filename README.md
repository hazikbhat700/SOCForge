# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to SOCForge

**SOCForge** is a SOC automation framework I developed to build a fully functional SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) solution from the ground up.

This project integrates powerful open-source tools â€” **Wazuh**, **Shuffle**, and **TheHive** â€” to simulate real-world SOC workflows, including log collection, alert generation, IOC enrichment, case management, and automated or analyst-driven response.

The goal was to create a flexible, modular system where each stage of detection and response could be automated, enriched with intelligence, and executed with minimal overhead â€” while remaining fully transparent and educational.

 Use my [DigitalOcean link](https://m.do.co/c/e2ce5a05f701) for **$200 free credit** for 60 days.

Explore the project, test it in your own lab, and feel free to expand it as your needs grow â€” the sky is the limit when it comes to automation.
